            <h3>King A.R.T.O.R, Germany </h3> Hi Everyone,<br>
            I am Olivia, nine years old and attending junior high school in Karlsruhe.
            The rest of the King ARTOR team members did not want to continue due to
            school commitments. We are all at the same grade, because I skipped two grades
            and very busy too, but I will have to find time for Dash and Dot by setting up my
            priorities like missing the piano lessons! They are so nice to play with and I
            would like to have one! It is also easier for me to understand the website,
            because I am bilingual. When I grow up I will build robots. I am learning to program
            in CoderDojo Karlsruhe almost for a year now. <br> Here we go Dash and Dot!

                <h3>Red and Green </h3>
                My mentor Ricarda (she is so nice) brought Dash and Dot to me in the afternoon,
                just after school. I laid out the mat on the floor and started to program Dash.<br>
                Dash will go to the first cup and see if Dot is there. <br>
                Dash turns green when it detects Dot and red when it does not.<br>
                After completing its mission, Dash will go to the second cup.<br>
                Dash went through couple of cm away and did not continue after the second cup!<br>
                I also forgot to program the stop block. <br>Will have to start over.<br>
                I discovered my mistake when I explained my program and
                found other possibilities to improve it.

                <h3>Meeting at the CoderDojo </h3>
                At the Coderdojo I built a platform from Legoblocks for the balls.
                My mentor forgot to bring the two balls with.<br> I made two paperballs instead.
                <br> Then I programmed Dash to carry the ball and throw them off
                one by one to each cup. Unfortunately, it didn't work without the
                funnel. That means, I still need to work on my platform. <br>I hope that's
                not much work.
                By the time I got home from CoderDojo it was very late in the evening and
                I haven't had dinner or done my homework!<br>
                I will build something better over the weekend and I hope that my mentor
                will remember to bring the balls! <br>Paperballs are heavier than ping pong balls
                and they do not roll well. <br> It was too loud in CoderDojo to make a movie.<br>
                We will meet at home again.

                <br>
                <h4>At the end:</h4> Am I done? Definitely not. But I am getting there.<br>
                Dear Diary, I must adjust it just a little bit.<br>
                The idea of blocking each ball with Lego is working.
                <br> I will build a funnel, because balls are bigger!<br>

                I spend the weekend working on my website.<br>
                Mum and I went to the Palace Park to make a short movie about our town today
                and took few pictures.<br>
                The weather was still very cold and there were people heading for a football game
                to support their club, because there is also a stadion within the park.
                <br>Did you know that Karlsruhe has an American Football Club?<br>
                The park is beautiful. It even has a small lokomotiv! <br>
                Its lake froze this year and I skated there. <br>I hope you will like our town.

                I crafted a platform from Lego. I do not have ping pong balls. The paper funnel was too small for the
                balls.
                I took a toilet paper roll and cut the top of it. I choose a pretty wrapping paper with stars to cover
                the roll.
                I secured it with a duct tape to prevent the balls from flying off when Dash shook its head.
                The tape also held the second ball on the top to keep it from rolling on Dash's first trip!
                All tried and tested and each time the balls flew away before this!
                Then I made the platform a bit lighter by removing some Lego blocks.
                The platform kept falling off. I secured it with a duct tape on top of Dash.<br>
                Today Dash didn't recognise Dot - What a pity! <br>
                Dash behaved silly and kept running away. Are they not supposed to be friends?
                I did not program it like that. Moreover, the battery was empty after one hour and
                charging took too long. I had to take a break. I intended to finish today, because I already lost two
                weeks
                at the beginning of this mission waiting for my team to decide! This is not going according to my plans!<br>

                I must prepare for a piano concert tomorrow evening.
                This week I missed my piano lessons. I skipped French drama classes, tennis, Chinese lessons and lots of
                other
                things.
                I cannot miss the concert, because I am playing the piano! <br>
                But I am happier today than yesterday, because I made it! Yes, the one of the cup is tipped over, but
                the
                ball went
                in.
                I planted the trees and they will grow for the baby pandas!
